and you look a little pale
when your eyes are just misspelled yeses
and you run to the soundtrack of a minefield
being planted
and then supplanted
for plague blossoms
and fickle magnets.

A legion of hunters are in hot pursuit
and their clothes
are on fire. Their fingernails
are coups for coffin lids and my thighs
are shaking in the sprint.

I remembered a story I'd heard once.
About the White Hart. An alabaster party guest going Stag
and stealing focus at all of King Arthur's dinner parties.
That animal had to be stopped.It is one more trophy
to pry the purity out from underneath and behind whom
all chaos would follow in its wake. Cursed and sworn,
She is the size of the last time I meant it just the way it came out.
All I wanted was a cool drink of water
without having to spit the buckshot back in my glass.

Now, I am certain
my foundation does not match my skin-tone anymore and I know
that if I slow down I'm gonna get hit where it counts.
What kind of archer drives in this rain of arrows anyway?
I know me as well as you do.
I am the bachelor party.
I am the hand grenade with a diamond pin.
I am the last time before you get old.
I am famous.

I am only explosions
and I can always deliver sparks.
I can swashbuckle you back into the first time you ever got snowballed
and everything will shine like a shipwreck in the dark.

I can't promise you that I will be there when you wake up
but I can promise that you will never forget that night.
When  our hearts were pounding and we danced
on the tables of Camelot.

That was the night we became legends.

I looked at you, doe-eyed,
and drained all of the color from your clothing.
I whispered in your ear like a rifle.
and we crashed like pianos because that
is the only kind of music I know.


I saw your new girlfriend today.
She's lovely. All covered in flowers. Soft.
Peaceful.

She looks like Gettysburg.

A calm so warm she could make dust storms settle their differences.
And when I imagine your slow breathing, your sleeping head resting
in the amber glow of her breasts.
I too can become a battlefield.

I can mean so many things:
adventure, salvation, the passion, the rapture,
an all out Armageddon, but God's sake… Peace!

I will never mean peace
to anyone.

I can only move like a meteor shower.
I can only quiet dinosaurs.
The only silence I know is the kind that signifies extinction.
I am that weapon you keep drawing back on and you finger that trigger
like it's yours to please.
But I know better.
I've dodged a few bullets in my day.

I am not the animal you keep.
I cannot be the trophy above the mantle
but I wish I were the hearth.
I wish I were her.

I wish I were the kind of place dogs go
to die. But I'm not. I am the girl you meet
before you meet
the girl you are going to marry.
She is always right behind me.
And there is chaos in my wake.

I thought the scorched sheets were all the proof one might need.
I mean, I would have told him sooner if I’d thought he hadn’t already picked up
on the fingerprint blisters on his ass or the boiling glass in the cupboards...

I thought he could tell from the first time.

When we kissed in the street a passing taxi-cab melted
into molten yellow soup. It greased over into oncoming traffic. All those tires
popping like the fourth of July even though it had been snowing for weeks.
Or the other day when he came at me with his face bleeding
from trying to shave with my drippy plastic razor all dulled on feather shafts
and quill shavings. I licked his cheek to cauterize the wound.
I mean seriously? Nothing would strike you as odd?

In the grocery store the shelves blast popcorn at our baskets
and all the frozen dinners were ready to eat
by the time we got to the melted ice-cream section.
He had to pay the cashier in silver plated ooze.
I mean come on, who wouldn’t think that was just a little weird?
But the day he called me an “angel”
before pulling a pillow fight from one of my pores?
I began to suspect he might have glossed over a few things here.

Lying under him I would crackle like driftwood
and he would shhh me.
I have never known silence
the way he could make it sound.
He would sing to me- some crap about the serenity in a falling leaf
and I thought only of the California hills smoking up those love-letter bonfires.
He would slide over the white noise of me
like an armada of full of bull snakes. He moved like new oil
slicking up my back like an itching gulf.

Now, I don’t remember much from sophomore chemistry but I’m pretty sure
This is dangerous.

I tried to warn him -
but by then the smoke had started filling his lungs and the ash cradled his bubbling limbs
into a perfect Pompeii.
I fell on him, painted in purity,
which is a kind of silencer muzzled over the mouth of a really great weapon.
He was flailing like a streamer in a tricycle accident,
His clothes were the first to go.
Then his arms.
Then his legs.
And then his panic! His panic was the prettiest storm!
My skin razed poppy-red and melted taxi-gold.
I glowed while he grayed.
When he finally settled
into the crossfire of the well lit night
he was as still as strange fruit hanging on my arm.

I whispered into the smoke of him
Don’t be afraid of changing forms. In the morning, I will rise
triumphant as always
out from under the ashes of every man
who has ever tried to outrun a mountain.")
