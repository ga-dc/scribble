# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# post1 = Post.create(title:"Making a Blog",body:"This is a blog post. Woo hoo.")
# post2 = Post.create(title:"Rrrrrrrrrrrrr",body:"Gwwwwwrrrrrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrr rrr.")
#
# c1 = Comment.create(comment:"Nice post, loser",post:post1)
# c2 = Comment.create(comment:"Well said",post:post2)
