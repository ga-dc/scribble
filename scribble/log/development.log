This book is\n     a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit\n      amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.

Richard McClintock, a Latin professor\n  at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,\n   and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections\n    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is\n     a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, Lorem ipsum dolor sit\n      amet.., comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from\nby Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham."], ["created_at", "2017-08-04 01:33:17.707573"], ["updated_at", "2017-08-04 01:33:17.707573"]]
